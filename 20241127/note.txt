Q: Working of factorial code 

The line `factorial *= i` is a shorthand for:

```python
factorial = factorial * i
```

### **Explanation in the Context of Factorial Calculation**
1. **Factorial Definition**:  
   The factorial of a number \( n \) is the product of all positive integers from \( 1 \) to \( n \). Mathematically:  
   \[
   n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \dots \times n
   \]

2. **Code Walkthrough**:  
   - Initially, the variable `factorial` is set to `1`:
     ```python
     factorial = 1
     ```
   - Inside the loop, the value of `factorial` is updated by multiplying it with the current loop variable `i`:
     ```python
     for i in range(1, num + 1):
         factorial *= i  # Multiply the current value of 'factorial' by 'i'
     ```

3. **How it Works**:  
   - On the first iteration, `factorial = 1 * 1`
   - On the second iteration, `factorial = 1 * 2`
   - On the third iteration, `factorial = 2 * 3`
   - ... and so on, until the loop ends.

4. **Example for `num = 5`**:
   - **Before the loop**: `factorial = 1`
   - **Iteration 1** (`i = 1`): `factorial = 1 * 1 = 1`
   - **Iteration 2** (`i = 2`): `factorial = 1 * 2 = 2`
   - **Iteration 3** (`i = 3`): `factorial = 2 * 3 = 6`
   - **Iteration 4** (`i = 4`): `factorial = 6 * 4 = 24`
   - **Iteration 5** (`i = 5`): `factorial = 24 * 5 = 120`

   Final result: \( 5! = 120 \).

---

In summary, `factorial *= i` is a compact way to iteratively multiply the current value of `factorial` by the loop variable `i`, enabling the calculation of the factorial.

# explain count = sum(1 for char in text if char in vowels) code from vowels in string

The line `count = sum(1 for char in text if char in vowels)` is a **Pythonic one-liner** that calculates the number of vowels in a string. Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 1. **Overall Purpose**
This code counts the number of characters in the string `text` that are vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).

---

### 2. **Components of the Code**
#### **a. `for char in text`**
- This is a **for loop** that iterates over each character (`char`) in the string `text`.

#### **b. `if char in vowels`**
- This is a conditional check that evaluates whether the current character (`char`) is in the string `vowels`.
- `vowels = "aeiou"` is the list of characters considered vowels.

#### **c. `1 for char`**
- For every character that satisfies the condition `if char in vowels`, the value `1` is generated.
- Essentially, it creates a sequence of `1`s, one for each vowel found.

#### **d. `sum(...)`**
- The `sum()` function adds up all the `1`s generated by the expression, giving the total count of vowels in `text`.

---

### 3. **How It Works (Step-by-Step Execution)**
Let’s assume the input is:
```python
text = "hello world"
vowels = "aeiou"
```

#### Iteration Process:
1. The loop goes through each character in `text`:
   - `'h'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'e'`: In `vowels` → add `1`.
   - `'l'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'l'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'o'`: In `vowels` → add `1`.
   - `' '`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'w'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'o'`: In `vowels` → add `1`.
   - `'r'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'l'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.
   - `'d'`: Not in `vowels` → no `1` added.

2. Generated sequence: `[1, 1, 1]` (one for each vowel: `'e'`, `'o'`, `'o'`).

3. The `sum()` function adds these values:  
   \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).

Result:
```python
count = 3
```

---

### 4. **Advantages of the Code**
- **Compact**: Achieves the task in a single, readable line of code.
- **Efficient**: Avoids unnecessary intermediate variables or loops.
- **Pythonic**: Leverages Python’s generator expressions for concise and elegant logic.

---

### 5. **Equivalent Expanded Code**
To better understand the functionality, here's an expanded version of the same logic:
```python
count = 0
for char in text:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1
```

Both versions yield the same result!
