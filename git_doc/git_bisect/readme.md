`git bisect` is a powerful tool used to find which commit introduced a bug in your project. It helps automate the process of binary search through the commit history to identify the exact commit that introduced a specific issue.

Here’s how `git bisect` works and some examples to illustrate how to use it effectively.

---

### **1. Basic Concept of `git bisect`**

The idea behind `git bisect` is to perform a binary search in the commit history. You start by specifying a "good" commit (a commit where the bug wasn’t present) and a "bad" commit (a commit where the bug is present). Git will then check out a commit in the middle of the range and ask if it’s good or bad, continuing the process to narrow down the range until the problematic commit is found.

---

### **2. Basic Steps for Using `git bisect`**

#### **Scenario:**
You know that a bug was introduced between two commits, but you don’t know which commit caused it. 

1. **Start Bisect:**
   Begin the bisecting process by telling Git the range of commits to search through. You specify a "good" commit and a "bad" commit.
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad           # Mark the current commit as bad (this is where the bug is)
   git bisect good <good-commit-hash>   # Mark an earlier known good commit
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad
   git bisect good abc12345  # Known good commit hash
   ```

2. **Git Bisect Chooses a Commit:**
   After marking the good and bad commits, Git will automatically checkout a commit halfway between the two. This commit will be referred to as the "current" commit.

3. **Test the Commit:**
   Now, you need to test the commit Git has checked out. You test it by running your application or running tests to determine if the bug exists in this commit.

4. **Mark the Commit as Good or Bad:**
   After testing, you let Git know if the current commit is good or bad:

   - If the bug is **not present** in the current commit, mark it as "good":
     ```bash
     git bisect good
     ```
   - If the bug **is present** in the current commit, mark it as "bad":
     ```bash
     git bisect bad
     ```

5. **Repeat the Process:**
   Git will continue to narrow down the range by checking out commits in the middle of the remaining range and asking you to test them. Each time you test a commit, mark it as "good" or "bad."

6. **Finish Bisecting:**
   Once you’ve identified the commit that introduced the bug, Git will tell you which commit is the culprit. To end the bisect session and return to the original branch, run:
   ```bash
   git bisect reset
   ```

### **3. Example of Using `git bisect`**

Let’s walk through a complete example where you are debugging an issue in a repository.

#### **Scenario:**
You know that the bug was introduced between two commits. The current commit has the bug, and the previous commit (hash `abc12345`) is known to be good.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Start the Bisecting Process:**
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad         # Mark the current commit as bad (has the bug)
   git bisect good abc12345   # Mark a commit known to be good (no bug)
   ```

2. **Git Chooses a Middle Commit:**
   Git will automatically checkout a commit in between the "good" and "bad" commits. Let's say it checks out `def67890`.

3. **Test the Commit:**
   Run the necessary tests or manually check if the bug is present in `def67890`.

   - If the bug is **not present**, mark it as "good":
     ```bash
     git bisect good
     ```

   - If the bug **is present**, mark it as "bad":
     ```bash
     git bisect bad
     ```

4. **Git Narrows Down the Range:**
   Git will continue this process, selecting commits between the "good" and "bad" points and asking you to test them.

5. **Final Commit:**
   Eventually, Git will tell you which commit introduced the bug. It will look something like:
   ```
   bisect run git bisect good commit abc12345
   ```

6. **Reset Bisect:**
   After finding the problematic commit, reset the bisect state:
   ```bash
   git bisect reset
   ```

### **4. Example of Bisecting with Automated Tests**

If your project includes automated tests, you can make `git bisect` fully automated by using `git bisect run`. This allows Git to automatically test commits and mark them as "good" or "bad" based on the results of a script or test.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Write a Script to Run Tests:**
   Create a script that runs the necessary tests and returns an exit code based on whether the tests pass or fail.

   For example, `test.sh`:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ./run-tests.sh   # Run your tests or application
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
     exit 0   # Tests passed, commit is good
   else
     exit 1   # Tests failed, commit is bad
   fi
   ```

2. **Run Bisect Automatically:**
   Now, you can start the bisect process and let Git run the tests automatically:
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   git bisect bad
   git bisect good abc12345
   git bisect run ./test.sh
   ```

   This will run `test.sh` for each commit in the range and automatically mark commits as good or bad based on whether the tests pass or fail.

### **5. Important `git bisect` Commands**

- **Start bisecting:**  
  ```bash
  git bisect start
  git bisect bad
  git bisect good <commit-hash>
  ```

- **Mark a commit as good:**  
  ```bash
  git bisect good
  ```

- **Mark a commit as bad:**  
  ```bash
  git bisect bad
  ```

- **Finish bisecting and reset:**  
  ```bash
  git bisect reset
  ```

- **Run bisect automatically with a test script:**  
  ```bash
  git bisect run <script-name>
  ```

---

### **6. When to Use `git bisect`**

- **When you know the bug was introduced between two specific commits** but don't know which one caused it.
- **When your project has a long history** and manually inspecting each commit would be time-consuming.
- **When you want to automate the process** using a script or automated test suite.

---

### **Summary**

`git bisect` is a very useful tool when debugging a bug introduced in a specific range of commits. It helps you efficiently locate the problematic commit by narrowing down the possible causes using binary search. You can manually mark commits as good or bad, or use automated tests to speed up the process.
