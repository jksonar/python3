### **What is `git rebase`?**

In Git, **rebasing** is a process that moves or reapplies commits from one branch onto another. It allows you to maintain a linear project history by transferring changes from one branch to another as if they were based directly on the new branch's history.

The basic syntax:
```bash
git rebase <branch>
```

---

### **Why Use Rebase?**
1. **Cleaner History:**
   Rebasing rewrites the commit history, making it look as though all changes were made sequentially on the base branch. This eliminates "merge commits" and creates a more readable project history.

2. **Applying Changes:**
   If you've branched off from a main branch and the main branch has progressed since, you can reapply your branch's changes onto the updated main branch to work with the latest changes.

3. **Conflict Resolution:**
   Rebasing helps ensure that all conflicts are resolved locally before integrating changes into a shared branch.

4. **Integration Without Merge Commit:**
   If you want to integrate changes from one branch to another without creating a merge commit, rebasing is a good choice.

---

### **How `git rebase` Works**
#### Example Scenario:
1. You have two branches: `main` and `feature`.
2. While working on `feature`, new commits were added to `main`.

#### Current State:
```
main:    A --- B --- C
                  \
feature:           D --- E
```

#### Command:
```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

#### After Rebase:
The `feature` branch commits (`D` and `E`) are reapplied onto the tip of `main`:
```
main:    A --- B --- C
                          \
feature (rebased):         D' --- E'
```

- `D'` and `E'` are rewritten commits, meaning their hashes will be different from the original `D` and `E`.

---

### **When to Use Rebase**

1. **Updating a Feature Branch:**
   If you are working on a feature branch and the main branch has progressed, you can rebase your branch to incorporate the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Before Merging:**
   To clean up commit history before merging into the main branch:
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   git checkout main
   git merge feature
   ```

3. **Interactive Rebase:**
   If you want to edit, squash, or reorder commits, you can use:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i <base-branch>
   ```

4. **Resolve Diverged History:**
   If two branches have diverged and you want to incorporate the latest changes from one branch into another, rebase can be a good choice.

---

### **Key Differences Between Rebase and Merge**
| Feature          | Rebase                                | Merge                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **History**       | Rewrites history for a linear view.  | Preserves all commits and creates merge commits. |
| **Use Case**      | Clean history, avoid merge commits.  | Retain detailed history of branch merges. |
| **Conflict Handling** | Conflicts resolved during rebase. | Conflicts resolved during merge. |

---

### **Cautions with Rebase**

1. **Rewriting History:**
   Rebasing changes commit hashes. Avoid rebasing branches that others are working on, as it can cause confusion and conflicts.

2. **Force Push Required:**
   After rebasing, you may need to force push (`git push --force`) to update the remote branch. Be cautious as this can overwrite shared history.

3. **Interactive Rebase Complexity:**
   When using interactive rebase (`-i`), it's possible to accidentally lose changes if not done carefully.

---

### **Interactive Rebase Example**
Suppose you have these commits:
```
A --- B --- C --- D --- E (feature)
```

You want to:
- Edit commit `C`.
- Combine (`squash`) `D` and `E` into a single commit.

Command:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

A text editor opens with a list of commits:
```
pick A
pick B
pick C
pick D
pick E
```

Modify the actions:
```
pick A
pick B
edit C
squash D
pick E
```

What happens:
- **`edit C`**: Lets you make changes to the commit.
- **`squash D`**: Combines `D` into the previous commit.

---

### Summary

Use `git rebase` to:
1. Maintain a clean, linear history.
2. Incorporate the latest changes from the base branch.
3. Edit, squash, or reorder commits interactively.

Rebase is powerful but should be used cautiously, especially in shared repositories. Let me know if you'd like hands-on examples!

### **What is Rebase?**

Rebasing in Git is the process of moving or applying commits from one branch onto another, effectively rewriting the commit history. It creates a cleaner, more linear history by incorporating changes without merge commits.

The basic syntax:
```bash
git rebase <base-branch>
```

When you rebase:
1. Git takes the commits from the current branch.
2. It temporarily "detaches" these commits.
3. It moves the branch to the tip of the `<base-branch>`.
4. Then, it re-applies the detached commits one by one onto the updated `<base-branch>`.

---

### **Why Use Rebase?**

- To **update a branch** with changes from the main branch.
- To **keep history linear** and readable.
- To **squash, reorder, or edit commits** (interactive rebase).
- To resolve conflicts while integrating changes.

---

### **Common Scenarios and Examples**

---

#### **1. Updating a Feature Branch**
If you're working on a feature branch and new commits have been added to the `main` branch, rebase the feature branch to incorporate the latest changes.

**Scenario:**
- `main`: `A --- B --- C`
- `feature`: `A --- B --- D --- E`

**Command:**
```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

**Result:**
- Rebases `feature` onto the tip of `main`:
  ```
  main:    A --- B --- C
                       \
  feature:              D' --- E'
  ```

- `D'` and `E'` are rewritten commits.

---

#### **2. Cleaning Up Commit History (Interactive Rebase)**

You can use interactive rebase to squash, reorder, or edit commits.

**Scenario:**
Your branch has these commits:
```
A --- B --- C --- D --- E (feature)
```

**Command:**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

A text editor opens with:
```
pick A Commit message for A
pick B Commit message for B
pick C Commit message for C
pick D Commit message for D
pick E Commit message for E
```

- **Squash Commits:**
  Change:
  ```
  pick C Commit message for C
  squash D Commit message for D
  ```
  Result: Combines `C` and `D` into one commit.

- **Reorder Commits:**
  Rearrange lines to reorder commits.

- **Edit Commit Messages:**
  Change `pick` to `edit` for a specific commit to modify its message or content.

---

#### **3. Incorporating Changes from Another Branch**
You can rebase a branch onto another branch to include its changes.

**Scenario:**
- `develop`: `A --- B --- C`
- `feature`: `D --- E`

**Command:**
```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase develop
```

**Result:**
- Moves `feature` to start from the tip of `develop`:
  ```
  develop: A --- B --- C
                            \
  feature:                  D' --- E'
  ```

---

#### **4. Resolving Conflicts During Rebase**
If conflicts occur during rebase, Git will pause and show a message.

**Steps:**
1. Resolve conflicts in the affected files.
2. Mark them as resolved:
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
3. Continue rebasing:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

**Abort the rebase if needed:**
```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

#### **5. Rebase Instead of Merge**
You can use rebase to avoid merge commits.

**Scenario:**
- Current branch: `feature`
- Target branch: `main`

**Command:**
```bash
git rebase main
```

Instead of merging `main` into `feature` (which creates a merge commit), rebasing applies `feature` commits on top of `main`.

---

#### **6. Rebasing onto a Specific Commit**
You can rebase a branch onto a specific commit, not just a branch.

**Scenario:**
- `main`: `A --- B --- C --- D`
- `feature`: `E --- F`

**Command:**
```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase C
```

**Result:**
- Rebases `feature` onto commit `C`:
  ```
  main:    A --- B --- C --- D
                       \
  feature:              E' --- F'
  ```

---

#### **7. Rebasing a Remote Branch**
To update your branch with changes from a remote branch.

**Command:**
```bash
git fetch
git rebase origin/main
```

---

### **Best Practices for Using Rebase**

1. **Don’t Rebase Public Branches:**
   Avoid rebasing branches shared with others, as it rewrites history and causes conflicts for collaborators.

2. **Use Interactive Rebase for Clean History:**
   Squash unnecessary commits to keep history concise.

3. **Force Push After Rebasing:**
   If you rebase a branch that has already been pushed, use:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

4. **Rebase Frequently on Feature Branches:**
   Rebase your feature branch often onto `main` or `develop` to reduce the complexity of conflicts.

### **How to Rebase When Pulling Latest Changes**

When working on a branch, you might need to incorporate the latest changes from a remote branch (e.g., `main`) into your branch. Instead of merging, you can use **`git pull --rebase`** to rebase your branch onto the updated remote branch. This keeps the history linear and avoids merge commits.

---

#### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

1. **Fetch the Latest Changes:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```
   This retrieves updates from the remote repository without merging or rebasing.

2. **Rebase Your Branch Onto the Updated Remote Branch:**
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin <base-branch>
   ```
   - This pulls the latest changes from `<base-branch>` (e.g., `main`) and rebases your current branch onto it.
   - If there are conflicts, Git will pause the rebase and notify you to resolve them.

3. **Resolve Conflicts (If Any):**
   - Open the conflicting files, resolve the conflicts, and mark them as resolved:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Continue the rebase process:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```
   - If you decide not to proceed, you can abort the rebase:
     ```bash
     git rebase --abort
     ```

4. **Push the Updated Branch:**
   After rebasing, the branch’s history will be rewritten, so you’ll need to force push:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

#### **Example**

Suppose your `feature-branch` is behind `main`:
```
main:          A --- B --- C --- D
feature-branch:     E --- F
```

1. Update your branch with the latest changes from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

2. After the rebase:
```
main:          A --- B --- C --- D
feature-branch:                     E' --- F'
```

3. Push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

---

### **Best Practices for Rebasing**

#### **1. Rebase Frequently on Long-Lived Feature Branches**
If your feature branch exists for a long time, regularly rebase it onto the main branch to stay up to date and minimize conflicts.

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

#### **2. Use Interactive Rebase for Commit Cleanup**
Before merging or pushing your branch, use `git rebase -i` to squash, reorder, or edit commits. This creates a clean and concise commit history.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~<number-of-commits>
```

#### **3. Avoid Rebasing Shared Branches**
Do not rebase branches that other team members are working on. Rebasing rewrites history and will cause issues for collaborators.

#### **4. Resolve Conflicts Immediately**
If conflicts occur during rebase, resolve them promptly:
- Open the conflicting files.
- Resolve the conflicts and stage the changes:
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```
- Continue the rebase:
  ```bash
  git rebase --continue
  ```

#### **5. Use `--onto` for Advanced Rebases**
When you want to move commits to a different branch or base commit:
```bash
git rebase --onto <new-base> <upstream> <branch>
```
For example:
```bash
git rebase --onto main feature~3 feature
```

#### **6. Always Force Push After Rebase**
Since rebasing rewrites history, you’ll need to use `git push --force` (or `--force-with-lease`) to update the remote branch.

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
This ensures you don’t accidentally overwrite changes made by others.

### **Choosing Between Rebase and Merge**

| **Scenario**                             | **Use Rebase**                 | **Use Merge**                  |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Keep history clean and linear**         | ✅                             | ❌                             |
| **Collaborative branches**                | ❌                             | ✅                             |
| **Conflict resolution**                   | ✅ (during rebase)              | ✅ (during merge)              |
| **Preserve detailed branch history**      | ❌                             | ✅                             |

### **Best Way to Rebase Branches**

1. **Keep Your Local Branch Up-to-Date:**
   Regularly rebase your branch onto `main` or the target branch to minimize conflicts.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Interactive Rebase Before Merging:**
   Clean up your commits to make the history concise and readable.

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~<number-of-commits>
   ```

3. **Push with Force Carefully:**
   After rebasing, use `git push --force-with-lease` to safely update the remote branch without overwriting changes made by others.

4. **Avoid Rebasing Shared Branches:**
   Use rebasing only on private or feature branches. For shared branches, prefer merging.
