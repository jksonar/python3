The `git revert` command is used to undo the effects of a commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes made in a specific commit. Unlike `git reset`, which removes commits from the history, `git revert` is a safer option when you want to maintain the commit history but undo changes.

Here are some examples and scenarios for using `git revert`:

---

### **1. Basic Usage: Revert a Single Commit**

The most common use case for `git revert` is to undo the changes introduced by a specific commit, while keeping the rest of the history intact.

#### **Scenario:**
You made a commit that introduced a bug, and you want to revert it.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Find the Commit Hash:**
   To identify which commit to revert, use:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   commit abc12345
   Author: John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
   Date:   Fri Jan 10 14:30:00 2025 -0500

       Add login feature

   commit def67890
   Author: John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
   Date:   Thu Jan 9 14:30:00 2025 -0500

       Update README file
   ```

   Let's say you want to revert the commit `abc12345`.

2. **Revert the Commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert abc12345
   ```
   This will open your default editor where you can modify the commit message if necessary. Save and close the editor to complete the revert.

3. **Commit the Revert:**
   After you exit the editor, Git will create a new commit that undoes the changes from `abc12345`.

---

### **2. Revert a Range of Commits**

You can also revert a range of commits, which is useful if you want to undo a sequence of commits rather than just a single one.

#### **Scenario:**
You want to revert the last three commits, perhaps because you introduced a bug across multiple commits.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Find the Commit Hash of the Range:**
   Use `git log` to identify the range of commits you want to revert.

2. **Revert the Range of Commits:**
   If you want to revert the last three commits, use the following command:
   ```bash
   git revert --no-commit HEAD~3..HEAD
   ```

   - `HEAD~3..HEAD` specifies the range of commits to revert, starting from three commits ago to the latest commit.
   - `--no-commit` stages the changes but doesn't commit them immediately, allowing you to inspect and modify them if needed.

3. **Commit the Revert:**
   After reviewing the changes, you can commit the revert:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Revert last 3 commits due to bugs introduced"
   ```

---

### **3. Revert a Merge Commit**

Reverting a merge commit requires special care since it has more than one parent. Git tries to determine how to undo a merge, and sometimes manual intervention is required.

#### **Scenario:**
You merged a feature branch and later found that the merge introduced issues. You want to revert the merge commit.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Find the Merge Commit Hash:**
   Use `git log` to find the hash of the merge commit.

2. **Revert the Merge Commit:**
   To revert a merge commit, use the `-m` option to specify which parent of the merge you want to keep (usually `1` for the first parent, or `2` for the second parent).

   ```bash
   git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
   ```

   - `-m 1` means that you want to keep the first parent of the merge (typically the main branch).
   - `<merge-commit-hash>` is the commit hash of the merge commit you want to revert.

   This will create a new commit that undoes the merge.

---

### **4. Handling Conflicts While Reverting**

When you revert a commit (especially in a range or merge), conflicts may arise. You’ll need to resolve them manually before completing the revert.

#### **Scenario:**
You reverted a commit, but there were merge conflicts because the changes in the commit affect parts of the code that are still active in the current branch.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Start the Revert:**
   Revert the commit or range of commits:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   If conflicts occur, Git will notify you about the conflicting files. Open those files and manually resolve the conflicts.

3. **Stage the Resolved Files:**
   Once you’ve resolved the conflicts, stage the changes:
   ```bash
   git add <file1> <file2>
   ```

4. **Complete the Revert:**
   After resolving the conflicts and staging the changes, complete the revert:
   ```bash
   git revert --continue
   ```

---

### **5. Canceling a Revert**

If you've started a revert but decide you don’t want to complete it, you can cancel the revert operation.

#### **Scenario:**
You started the revert operation but realized you don’t want to undo the changes.

#### **Steps:**
To cancel a revert:
```bash
git revert --abort
```
This will stop the revert process and return the repository to its previous state before the revert started.

---

### **6. Reverting a Commit That Was Already Pushed**

If you’ve already pushed a commit to a remote repository and want to revert it, you can still use `git revert`. This is a safer option than `git reset` because it keeps the commit history intact and avoids potential issues for other collaborators.

#### **Scenario:**
You pushed a commit to the remote repository and now want to undo the changes without affecting the shared history.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Revert the Commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Push the Reverted Commit:**
   After you’ve committed the revert locally, push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

### **Summary of Git Revert Command**

- **Revert a single commit:**  
  ```bash
  git revert <commit-hash>
  ```

- **Revert a range of commits:**  
  ```bash
  git revert <old-commit-hash>..<new-commit-hash>
  ```

- **Revert a merge commit:**  
  ```bash
  git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
  ```

- **Resolve conflicts during revert:**  
  1. Resolve conflicts in the conflicting files.
  2. Stage the resolved files.
  3. Complete the revert:
     ```bash
     git revert --continue
     ```

- **Cancel a revert:**  
  ```bash
  git revert --abort
  ```

- **Push the reverted changes to remote:**  
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```

### **Best Practices for Using `git revert`**

1. **Use `git revert` Instead of `git reset` for Public Commits:**  
   `git revert` is safe for undoing changes that have already been pushed to a shared repository. `git reset`, on the other hand, is better suited for local changes that haven’t been shared with others.

2. **Revert Small, Logical Changes:**  
   If possible, try to revert specific changes that logically correspond to a particular commit. Avoid reverting large swathes of changes unless necessary.

3. **Test After Reverting:**  
   After reverting a commit, thoroughly test your code to ensure that the changes didn’t introduce any issues.
