pip install psycopg2

Python Script for PostgreSQL CRUD Operations

Here's a complete example script that demonstrates connecting to PostgreSQL, creating a table, and performing CRUD operations:

Key Points in the Script

    Connection:
        psycopg2.connect establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the credentials in DB_CONFIG.

    CRUD Functions:
        create_table: Ensures the table exists before performing operations.
        insert_data: Inserts a new row into the employees table.
        read_data: Fetches and displays all rows from the table.
        update_data: Updates specific fields for a row identified by id.
        delete_data: Deletes a row based on its id.

    SQL Injection Prevention:
        Use %s placeholders with parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.

    Error Handling:
        Catch and print exceptions for debugging.

    Dynamic Update:
        Update only the fields provided by dynamically building the query.

====================================================================================================================
Great! Let’s dive deeper into PostgreSQL operations with Python using psycopg2. We’ll address more advanced use cases and common requirements, including:

    Using Connection Pools for better performance.
    Transactions for committing or rolling back operations.
    Parameterizing Configuration using .env or configuration files.
    Advanced Querying (joins, subqueries, etc.).
    Using Context Managers for cleaner code.
    Error Handling best practices.
    Pagination for large datasets.

1. Using Connection Pools

A connection pool is a collection of database connections that can be reused, improving performance for applications with frequent database access.

2. Transactions

Transactions ensure that multiple queries execute as a single unit. If one query fails, the others can be rolled back.

3. Parameterizing Configuration

To avoid hardcoding credentials, use environment variables or a .env file with the python-dotenv library.

5. Using Context Managers

Context managers (with blocks) ensure connections and cursors are properly closed, even if an error occurs.

7. Pagination for Large Datasets

For large datasets, use LIMIT and OFFSET to fetch data in chunks.

8. Perform Bulk Inserts

For efficiency, use bulk insert queries or copy methods.
